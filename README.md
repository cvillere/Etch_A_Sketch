This is the Etch_A_Sketch project from the Odin Project curriculum. 

After completing this project I will know how to setup a grid in HTMl/CSS using
DOM manipulation in javascript. I will know how to use event listeners to trig
on certain keyboard/mouse movement with functions. 

I will know how to make the grid dynamic based upon a number the user passes in
based on a prompt.
